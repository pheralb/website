## Introduction

The [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) is a web development stack made by [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) focused on simplicity, modularity, and **full-stack typesafety**. The stack includes:

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
- [Next.js + Typescript](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for building web apps.
- [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) - Authentication for Next.js.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - Full-stack typesafe API layer.

Before you start creating your first app, you need some prerequisites:

- [Node.js +16](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- React, Typescript and **Next.js** knowledge.
- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) account (it's free).

## Create a new T3 app:

```bash
npx create-t3-app@latest my-app
```
