## Introduction

Hono is a new framework for building fast APIs with Cloudflare Workers. It's a framework that allows you to build APIs with a simple and intuitive syntax, and it's built on top of Cloudflare Workers. It's a great way to build APIs that are fast, secure, and scalable.

## Install the Workers CLI

The first thing you need to do is install the Workers CLI. This is a command line tool that allows you to create and manage your Workers projects. You can install it with your favorite package manager:

```bash {2,3,4}
# with npm:
npm install -g wrangler

# with yarn:
yarn global add wrangler

# with pnpm:
pnpm add -g wrangler

# with ultra:
ultra add wrangler
```

and then run this command to log in to your Cloudflare account:

```bash
wrangler login
```

## Create a new project

Now that you have the Workers CLI installed, you can create a new project. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
wrangler init hono-app
```
